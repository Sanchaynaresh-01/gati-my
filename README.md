## Key Features

1. **Scroll-Driven Assam Journey Animation**:
   - **Left**: Tasteful illustration of an Assamese tea garden worker carrying a traditional tea basket on her back with natural atmospheric sway and parallax.
   - **Center**: A natural winding pathway through Assam connecting all 12 competition stages, with a student boy traveler whose position dynamically tracks scroll progress.
   - **Right**: Rich Assam landscape composition (tea terraces, hills, bamboo groves, tropical leaves) extending past the viewport edge with multi-depth parallax.
   - **12 Interactive Checkpoints**: Milestone cards appearing intelligently along the pathway as the student journeys through the competition.
2. **Multi-Role Authentication & School Code System**:
   - Role-based access control for **Administrator**, **School**, **Student / Team**, and **Evaluator**.
   - Unique public School Code generation upon Admin approval (e.g. `AFIP-AS-KAM-00001`), indexed uniquely in MongoDB.
   - Team Codes (e.g. `AFIP-T-00001`) immutably linked to school ObjectIds.
3. **Four Functional Dashboards**:
   - **School Dashboard (`/school/dashboard`)**: Track enrolled teams, create teams, add mentors, and monitor milestones.
   - **Student Dashboard (`/student/dashboard`)**: Team member roster, server-timed Knowledge Assessment Quiz card, and project submission portal with automatic team/school linkage.
   - **Evaluator Dashboard (`/evaluator/dashboard`)**: View only assigned submissions (strict 403 authorization guard on unassigned entries), 7-criteria 100-mark rubric scoring, draft saving, and submission locking.
   - **Admin Control Panel (`/admin/dashboard`)**: School & evaluator approvals, project assignment to jury, stage advancement, leaderboard visibility toggle, and system audit logs.
4. **Public Pages**:
   - **Home (`/`)**: Hero, overview, scroll journey, stats, funnel, 14 priority themes, prizes, leaderboard preview, and CTA.
   - **About (`/about`)**: Mission, vision, regional context ("Why Assam?"), eligibility, and outcomes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router v6, Axios, Framer Motion, GSAP & GSAP ScrollTrigger, Lucide Icons.
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended, PyMongo, Flask-CORS, Bcrypt, Pytest, Mongomock.
- **Database**: MongoDB (Atlas compatible, with zero-config in-memory fallback for local demo).

---

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18+ (tested on v22.14.0)
- **Python**: v3.10+ (tested on v3.10.11)
- **MongoDB**: (Optional) MongoDB local or Atlas URI. If no local mongod service is running, the backend automatically falls back to an embedded mock database for immediate zero-config operation.

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux / macOS
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run backend server
python app.py
```
The Flask REST API will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
In a separate terminal window:
```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite development server
npm run dev
```
Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` in your browser.
